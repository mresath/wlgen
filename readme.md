# WlGen

**WlGen** is a simple wordlist generator. It takes a keyword list, which can be generated by using OSINT tools like [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL), and creates a list of possible matches from it.

## Usage

```
$ python3 wlgen [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-d DEPTH] file

positional arguments:
  file                  File containing a list of keywords.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        File to output into (optional, will print out otherwise).
  -d DEPTH, --depth DEPTH
                        How many keywords to combine into each password, default and recommended value is 2.
```

## Tips

- If you want to access WlGen from any directory without having to navigate to its folder, you can define an **alias**.

    In you shell config (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) add:

    ```
    alias wlgen="python3 /path/to/wlgen/wlgen.py"
    ```

    and you will be able to run it simply with:

    ```
    $ wlgen keywords.txt [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-d DEPTH] file

    positional arguments:
      file                  File containing a list of keywords.

    options:
      -h, --help                  show this help message and exit
      -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                            File to output into (optional, will print out otherwise).
      -d DEPTH, --depth DEPTH
                            How many keywords to combine into each password, default and recommended value is 2.
    ```
